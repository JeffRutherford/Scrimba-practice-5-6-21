# Scrimba-practice-5-6-21

I'm working on multiple platforms to learn coding - Scrimba, Treehouse, App Academy, and Free Code Camp. I'm not hopscotching between languages and frameworks. I keep circling back and forth over the same topics to reinforice my learning.

Most recently, I'm working through the Front End Developer Career Path on Scrimba, and this is just some very basic HTML formatting and files.
